# NRC: NEO Robot Communication

NRC (NEO Robot Communication) is a decentralized platform for human-robot communication. It allows an autonomous car to obtain other vehicles' information which may not be detectable by its onboard sensors to avoid potential collisions.

Consider an autonomous driving example illustrated in the following figure (left column). The autonomous car tries to navigate through an unsignalized intersection while interacting with another human driver on road.  

Although it is a trival task for human drivers, it turns out to be extremely difficult for a robot car to perform well in such scenario. In order to be safe and efficient, the robot car needs to know the positions of nearby human driven cars and the paths that human drivers are following.

## Incentive

Vehicles can post their geolocations to the NRC platform. 
To obtain these geolocations, a self-driving car needs to pay some NRC token for a ticket which is valid within a certain amount of blocks. 
The NRC token paid are then distributed to the geolocation-posters, which motivates the them to continue posting their locations.
